  ## Forms:
  (https://github.com/sarahlutaaya256/html.forms) <br>
  The HTML form was one of my first project where I worked on HTML forms. I first coded my html codes and further went a head to style my form using some bit of external css style also  i used inline css too.Here in htlm i wrapped up my form by using Fieldset.
  This form is about personal sign up details.

  ## Built with:
  HTML5
  CSS style 
  
  ## Resources:
  (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)<br>
  I used W3Schools for research and coming up with the desired form.
